It represents the firm's contribution to a country's gross domestic product, which is the value of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the country.  Compared to sales, value added is a preferable measure of production because it indicates the extent to which a firm's sales result from their own production rather than from production that originates elsewhere, whereas sales data do not distinguish between these two sources of production.  Value added can be measured as gross output minus intermediate inputs; alternatively, it can be measured as the sum of the costs incurred (except for intermediate inputs) and the profits earned in production.  The value-added estimates presented here were prepared by summing the costs and profits data.</td></tr></table><table border="1"><tr><th scope="col">key</th><th>desc</th></tr><caption>MNE Parameter GetFootnotes Values</caption><tr><td>no</td><td>footnotes are not included</td></tr><tr><td>yes</td><td>footnotes are included</td></tr></table><table border="1"><tr><th scope="col">key</th><th>desc</th></tr><caption>MNE Parameter Investment Values</caption><tr><td>all</td><td> all</td></tr><tr><td>164</td><td>Assets</td></tr><tr><td>150</td><td>Current employment</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>First-year expenditures</td></tr><tr><td>159</td><td>Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>165</td><td>Owner's Equity</td></tr><tr><td>152</td><td>Planned employment</td></tr><tr><td>112</td><td>Planned total expenditures</td></tr><tr><td>000</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>121</td><td>U.S. businesses acquired</td></tr><tr><td>122</td><td>U.S. businesses established</td></tr><tr><td>123</td><td>U.S. businesses expanded</td></tr></table><table border="1"><tr><th scope="col">key</th><th>desc</th></tr><caption>MNE Parameter ParentInvestment Values</caption><tr><td>all</td><td> all</td></tr><tr><td>164</td><td>Assets</td></tr><tr><td>150</td><td>Current employment</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>First-year expenditures</td></tr><tr><td>159</td><td>Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>165</td><td>Owner's Equity</td></tr><tr><td>152</td><td>Planned employment</td></tr><tr><td>112</td><td>Planned total expenditures</td></tr><tr><td>000</td><td>Total</td></tr></table><table border="1"><tr><th scope="col">ParameterName</th><th>ParameterDataType</th><th>ParameterDescription</th><th>ParameterIsRequiredFlag</th><th>ParameterDefaultValue</th><th>MultipleAcceptedFlag</th><th>AllValue</th></tr><caption>FixedAssets Parameters</caption><tr><td>TableName</td><td>string</td><td>The new Fixed Assets identifier</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>0</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>integer</td><td>List of year(s) of data to retrieve (X for All)</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>X</td></tr></table><table border="1"><tr><th scope="col">TableName</th><th>Description</th></tr><caption>FixedAssets Parameter TableName Values</caption><tr><td>FAAt101</td><td>Table 1.1.
